wp_uuid_create
==============

UUID Creator: if something went wrong with an update of Contao from a version prior 3.2 and now all e.g. images are gone, because wrong values are stored in the singleSRC and multiSRC Fields, this tool may fix it.

I hope this will help somebody, who has got the same problem like I had.
